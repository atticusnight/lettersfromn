    <itunes:summary>A peculiar, serialized podcast weaving the convoluted story of a forgotten life. Following a trail of letters signed with the letter “N” alone, Cal must learn about the strange life of N and his own haunted past. He finds himself on a mountaintop, with nothing but a voice recorder to keep him sane. Following his thoughts and recordings, he comes upon a series of letters-letters from N-and we come upon a dark, convoluted mystery. In this podcast, a mild psychological mystery meets a radiodrama, and adds a hint of humour. Infused with mythology and told in a series of scripted episodes, this serialized podcast is unlike any other.</itunes:summary>
