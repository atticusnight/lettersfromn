    <itunes:summary>Letters From N is a peculiar, serialized podcast weaving the convoluted story of a forgotten life. Following a trail of letters signed with the letter “N” alone, Cal must learn about the strange life of N and his own haunted past. He finds himself on a mountaintop, with nothing but a voice recorder to keep him sane. He comes upon a series of letters-letters from N-and we, following, come upon a dark, convoluted mystery. In Letters From N, a psychological thriller-slash-mystery meets a radiodrama, adding a hint of humour. Infused with mythology and told in a series of scripted episodes, this serialized podcast is unlike any other.</itunes:summary>
